Hello, this Da. If you have diffcult while accessing this reposity, please try the following steps:

1. Use the username in your account page.
   IT COULD BE DIFFERENT FROM YOUR NSID!

2. Set a password in your account page.

3. If you are accessing reposity using HTTPS, remember to keep GIT_SSL_NO_VERIFY=true in your environment variables. The server is using a self-signed (or self-issued) certificate, which cause troubles.

4. If you are using SSH, remember to import a SSH key.

5. I hope there is no more diffculties.
