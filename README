Hello, this Da. If you have diffcult while accessing this reposity, please try the following steps:

1. Use the username in your account page.
   IT COULD BE DIFFERENT FROM YOUR NSID!

2. Set a password in your account page.

3. If you are accessing reposity using HTTPS:
   The server is using a self-signed (or self-issued) certificate, which cause troubles.

    3a. For command-line users: 
        Remember to keep GIT_SSL_NO_VERIFY=true in your environment variables.

    ~~3b. For Eclipse users:~~
        ~~a) open Window->Preferences->Team->Git->Configuration~~
        ~~b) Click the New Entry button~~
        ~~c) Add the following:~~
            ~~Key = http.sslVerify~~
            ~~Value = false~~

        ~~Reference: http://gitblit.com/faq.html~~
    It does not work on my computer. Anybody has ideas?

4. If you are using SSH, remember to import a SSH key.

5. I hope there is no more diffculties.
