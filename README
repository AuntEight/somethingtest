Hello, this is Da. If you have diffcult while accessing this reposity, please try the following steps:

1. Use the username in your account page.
   IT COULD BE DIFFERENT FROM YOUR NSID!

2. Set a password in your account page.

3. If you are accessing reposity using HTTPS:
   The server is using a self-signed (or self-issued) certificate, which cause troubles.

    3a. For command-line users: 
        Remember to keep GIT_SSL_NO_VERIFY=true in your environment variables.

    3b. For Eclipse users:
        Tested on Eclipse Kepler/egit 3.0.3.201309161630.
	Failed on earlier Eclipse/egit combination.
        a) Open Window->Preferences->Team->Git->Configuration
        b) Click the New Entry button
        c) Add the following:
            Key = http.sslVerify
            Value = false

        Reference: http://gitblit.com/faq.html
    

4. If you are using SSH, remember to import a SSH key. You may need MINGW32 on Windows to use ssh-keygen.

5. I hope there is no more diffculties.

6. Forget the strange name.
